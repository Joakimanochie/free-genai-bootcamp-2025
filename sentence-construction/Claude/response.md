Let me help you break this down into manageable parts for translation.

Vocabulary Table:
| Japanese | Romaji | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| 寒い | samui | cold (feeling) |
| 毛布 | moufu | blanket |
| 感じる | kanjiru | to feel |
| 取る | toru | to get/take |

Sentence Structure:
This can be broken into two parts:
1. [Subject] [cold] [feel]
2. [Object] [get] (question/request form)

Clues and Considerations:
* This is a compound sentence combining a statement and a request
* For the first part, consider:
  - When expressing feelings in Japanese, you don't typically need the "I feel" part - you can directly state the feeling
  - The feeling of cold uses an i-adjective
* For the second part, consider:
  - This is a polite request
  - You'll need to use the te-form to make it a polite request
  - Think about what particle would mark the object (blanket) in this case

Try forming the sentence! Remember to consider the polite form since you're making a request.
